           Hello I'm Mynam Dhanush, studying in Mrcet college.i have plenty of experience in interacting with new people as I'm a board member of a NGO named "Be The Change". I easily meet 10 to 15 new people every day by this you can make an estimation about my communication skills and coming to my technical skills I'm a web designer, an android developer,a computer programmer,and data analyist. Keeping all my skillset apart I'm a sports person who can play volleyball,cricket,basketball,football.I could myself say I'm an optimist person and most importantly I'm a very quick learner, many people say this line but I really mean it.
